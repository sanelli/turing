# Pascal implementation
Implemented using [FreePascal](https://www.freepascal.org).

## Pros
- I like syntax where you specify every detail (`procedure` vs `function` is 😍)
- I like having `set` type, despite them being limited to ordinal types
- Great having a dynamic array implementation, I was not expecting it

## Cons
- Syntax feels a bit outdated (as expected)
