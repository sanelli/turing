# Ada

## Pros
- I like that it is very clear in its intent;
- Very good string typing;
- Very good tooling account to style by default;

## Cons
- Default style feels very outdated (e.g. space between function name and parameters);
- The fact that I cannot add empty parenthesys to call a function without parmeters;
- Unclear to me there you can use `with` with functions (e.g. `with Ada.Strings.Unbounded.Hash;`) for sub-routines outside packages;
